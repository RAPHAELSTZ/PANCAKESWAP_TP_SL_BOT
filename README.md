#PANCAKE SWAP BOT 26th of May 2021

This robot allows swapping between BEP20 tokens on Pancake Swap, just like a human beeing would do.
it is mimicking the behavior of a Lambda user. Its purpose is to allow user to stay AFK (go to sleep) and handle his Swappings at Take profit/Stop Loss pre-registered prices. This version is the UI version of the previous CONSOLE. This is the main project.

Pre-requisite : **Google Chrome **Version 90+ (it might work on earlier version but not tested)

HOW TO USE:

Make sure you have connected METAMASK with your password (Robot does not handle login, and won't)
Close ALL Pancake swap tabs, windows..
Launch Bot
it is not 100%Â¨accurate, sometimes bot will just freeze forever and you might not swap at the right time, you might not even stop loss correctly. /!\ It is mainly for sleeping purposes. You can get to sleep while letting the PC ON.
